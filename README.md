Developed a web application using deep learning to forecast stock prices in real time for S&P 500 companies.

**Technologies Used**: 
Python, Streamlit, LSTM models, Yahoo Finance API 

**Project Overview:** 
The app leverages LSTM models to analyze and predict stock price movements. It integrates with the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve real-time and historical data for S&P 500 companies, enabling training on extensive datasets. Trained on 15 years of historical data, the LSTM model captures long-term dependencies in time-series data, allowing for accurate short-term predictions of up to 30 days.

**Key Features and Methodology:**
- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** The app pulls real-time data from the Yahoo Finance API and preprocesses it to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for training.
- Model Training and Optimization: The LSTM model, selected for its ability to learn patterns in sequential data, was fine-tuned with hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs to enhance accuracy and robustness.
- Real-Time Predictions: The trained model provides real-time predictions based on the latest stock data. The user interface, built with Streamlit, allows users to select companies, view trends, and assess future price predictions.

**Professional Impact:**
The web app applies deep learning to financial data, offering investors and analysts tools for data-driven decisions. By accurately forecasting stock prices, it helps optimize investment strategies and manage risks, demonstrating expertise in quantitative analysis and financial modeling.
